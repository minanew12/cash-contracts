# ether.fi Cash Smart Contracts

Welcome to the ether.fi Cash Smart Contracts repository! This project powers the ether.fi Cash product, providing seamless debit and credit functionalities for users.

## Overview

ether.fi Cash allows users to manage their funds through two primary mechanisms:

- **Debit:** Users spend their own funds via the ether.fi card, with transactions flowing directly from their UserSafe contracts to the ether.fi Cash multisig wallet.
- **Credit:** Users can borrow funds by supplying collateral to the ether.fi Debt Manager. These funds are available for spending with the ether.fi card, much like a traditional credit card, but backed by the user's collateral.

## Key Contracts
